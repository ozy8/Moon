PryceIt is a social media platform which seeks to solve the problem of price comparison of goods in various locations. We have always believed in the power of crowdsourcing and that is what PryceIt is for, to let users submit answers - or prices in this case.

No more travelling back and forth different places trying to figure out if you have got the best deal. Just browse through the site to get a better idea.

PryceIt - You pry into the price, for your benefit.
